        <p>
          I’m Wang Yufeng, a Computer Science student who enjoys learning by building.
          I’m interested in software engineering and AI-related applications, and I like projects that require both
          logical thinking and careful execution. In teamwork, I communicate clearly, take ownership of my tasks,
          and try to make the final result neat, readable, and dependable.

            <h3>Post 1: Building my first one-page personal site</h3>
            <p>
              I learned how to structure a page using sections and anchor links, and how external CSS controls layout and style.
              Small details like spacing, typography, and consistency make the website look much more professional.

            <p>
              I practiced organizing folders clearly, making meaningful commits, and pushing updates to a public repository.
              This helps me keep my work traceable and easy to review.
